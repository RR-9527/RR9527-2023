/**
 * A class to persist the state of the visualizer window.
 * <p>Basically saves the position of the {@link MeepMeep} GUI window so that it opens in the some position
 * that it was closed in.
 *
 * <p> Basic usage example:
 * <pre>{@code MeepMeep meepMeep = new MeepMeep(windowSize);
 *
 * // Create a persistence object linked to the MeepMeep instance
 * MeepMeepPersistence persistence = new MeepMeepPersistence(meepMeep);
 *
 * // Restore the settings from the persistence object to the MeepMeep instance
 * persistence.restore();}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> The settings autosave every 2 seconds, and when MeepMeep is closed from the 'X'.
